# UPP
Secure Locker System, based on the observer pattern with event sourcing and finite state machines. 
Planned Prototype uses a RasPi-controlled Arduino Uno, which orchestrates the relays for the locks/sensors/led strips.

First version only uses the system for pickup but requires manual loading (existing customer requirements). 
Second version will extend this by also enabling a digitally-supported loading of the lockers by the super-user and allocating some of the ad-hoc admin capabilities to the super-user.
